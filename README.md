# Shamsi Time

Shamsi Time is a versatile application designed to display the current date in the Persian calendar (Jalali calendar) as a system notification on your desktop. This utility not only provides an easy way to view the current Persian day of the week, month, and date but also offers a new online mode for enhanced functionality.

## Features

-   **Dual Mode Functionality**: Choose between online and offline modes.
    -   **Online Mode**: Retrieves the current time from `time.ir` and caches it for the day. Displays occasions and indicates if it's an official holiday.
    -   **Offline Mode**: If the application is offline or unable to fetch data online, it will automatically switch to offline mode after some time. This mode doesn't display occasions or official holidays.
-   **User Configurable**: Easily switch between online and offline modes through the `config.txt` file.
-   **System Tray Integration**: Displays the Persian date in the system tray for quick access.
-   **Desktop Notifications**: Clicking the tray icon shows a detailed notification with the full date, occasions, and holiday status (in online mode).
